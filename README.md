## Synopsis

A game of BlackJack: week three project at Skill Distillery.

### Requirements

1. Your program must NOT be contained in one procedural Main. You MUST design a OO class structure.
When the game begins both the player and dealer are dealt two cards.
2. If a player or dealer is dealt 21 the game is over. Otherwise the player can choose to hit or stay.
3. Once the player has completed their turn the dealer will begin their turn.
4. The game is immediately over if either player gets above 21.

### How to Play

Download the game files and run it from Game.java. Enter your name and the dealers name. Two initial cards are dealt to the player and the dealer. If neither the player nor the dealer get BlackJack on the first turn, the player will be presented with a choice, either "hit" or "stand". After the player's turn it is the dealers turn, and this goes on until someone scores 21, busts, or both players stand, at which time the game judges the winner. An Ace can count as either a 1 or a 21.

### Improvements

I need to improve the design of this program. As it stands the code is unweildy. I think refactoring and increasing the modularity of this program will help especially, if in the future, I want to add upon the program.

Better understanding program design is my ultimate goal, so that I can make changes that don't cascade throughout the program.

I would also like to add Junit tests.
